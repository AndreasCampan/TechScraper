# TechScraper
I decided to build this web scraper to quickly find computer parts on some main online computer stores. (MemoryExpress, Newegg and amazon).

This code is open source and free to use.

You'll need to clone this repo locally and npm install the packages.

Afterwards, feel free to alter the searchTerms array to find the products you're interested in.

THe results will be exported to an excel file located at the root of this project.

Send me a message if you have any questions!
